Title: Functions to Generate Species Distribution Models using the JNCC SDM Framework
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Joint Nature Conservation Committee <info@jncc.gov.uk>
Maintainer: Joint Nature Conservation Committee <info@jncc.gov.uk>
Description: This package provides several functions for species distribution modelling using a suite of models on your data and returning the best model based on AUC. The functions provide assistance both with single species modelling and with multi-species modelling running through a list of species. The package also facilitates in the randomisation of placements of pseudo-absences and the locations of presence points where these are at lower-resolution than environmental predictor datasets, as well as the preparing of data specifically from NBN Atlas and NBN Gateway resources.
